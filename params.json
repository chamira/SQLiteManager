  "body": "## Welcome to the SQLiteManager wiki!\r\n\r\n### \"Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler\" - Albert Einstein\r\n\r\n\r\nIdea is to have a simple [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) interface to run basic [SQL](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) statements/queries such as CREATE TABLE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.\r\nThere are many iOS libraries that are well capable of doing complicated SQLite stuff but almost all of those libraries have more than what we need for small projects. \r\nThus, the idea is to get rid of all the boilerplate code and keep things very simple. You write your own SQL.\r\n\r\nModeling, Handling objects, writing business logic is all up to the developers.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nTo run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nMin iOS SDK 8.0<br /> \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nSQLiteManager is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install\r\nit, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\r\n\r\n### Author\r\n\r\nChamira Fernando, chamira.fdo@gmail.com, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chamirafernando)\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nSQLiteManager is available under the MIT license.
